## About me

I'm Dmitriy Kiriyenko, I live in Grodno, I'm a software architect and do my trivial chores just like all of us. Here I'll put my thoughts, ideas and stories about what I do, what I learn and how I try to do better.

* I work in Crossover on a huge legacy microserviced app on Ruby on Rails, reactjs, json api, Kafka and a lot of other buzzwords. If I meet something interesting, I'll write about it here.
* I work from home with all the good and bad consequences of that. I worked from home long before it became a mainstream and get used to it way too much. As such, I'll sometimes share some ideas on how to make working from home easier, more fun and productive.
* I got a beautiful wife and two awesomely smart kids which constantly inspire me to do better.
* To counteract physically passive job I went with gym and healthy food and at the moment turned my third degree of obesity into an acceptable form and consider myself a sport guy. As a part of shameful self-promotion I'll sometimes share my success and how I got in this blog.
* This essentially cuts the time I can spend on video games by a large margin, but I won't give up and continue do my best to at least sometimes advance with that hobby. Best impressions will contribute to this blog.
* However, books also require some time and you may expect quite a bit of book reviews here, under a label 'reading club'.
* Being a huge fun of lifehacks and other smart "productivity" things I will most likely write about them here quite a bit.
